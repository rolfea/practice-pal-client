Starting to get the design organized. I have created a user stories file to
keep those separate. I'll try this for now in order to have everything central,
but I could see breaking this out into a wiki or trello if it gets too big.

I'm not interested in implementing premium users or admins right now. My first
priority is getting a basic user CRUD operations working.
